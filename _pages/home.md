The mission of the Katsevich Lab is to unravel the regulatory wiring of the human genome, with the ultimate goal of understanding the molecular basis of human diseases. 

To this end, we develop novel statistical methodologies to analyze the data produced by cutting-edge single cell genomics assays, such as single cell CRISPR screens and single cell multi-omics data. We back these methods with statistical theory and implement them in high-quality softwares aimed at biologists.

 **We are  looking for passionate new master students, PhD students, postdocs, and bioinformaticians to join the team.** 

We are grateful for funding from the [National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/) and [Analytics at Wharton](https://analytics.wharton.upenn.edu/).
